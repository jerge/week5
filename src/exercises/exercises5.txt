**** Exercises week 5 ***

-   Exercises are helpful if you choose the harder version of lab4.
    Else they are not needed in labs, but of course increases your skills
    If new to programming probably should use these later as examples of harder problems.


Exercises
---------
1.  See Ex1SplitInteger. Split an integer into a sum of n random terms (return array or list).
    Example: Split 7 into 4 integers
    Some possible solutions
        [4, 2, 1, 0]
        [0, 1, 2, 4]
        [0, 2, 3, 2]
        [2, 3, 1, 1]
        [3, 3, 1, 0]

    Method must be reasonable efficient and have a reasonable distribution of the n integers.

2.  See Ex2SplitList. Partition a list into sub lists with as equal length as possible. See comments.

3.  See Ex3Grouping. Group collection of items into different list classified by some
    value for some attribute. You should use a Map (kind of collection).

4.  See Ex5Permutations. Implement an imperative algorithm for permutation of Strings.
    Use String or optional try StringBuffer (for efficiency).

    See Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter permutation algorithm iteratively
